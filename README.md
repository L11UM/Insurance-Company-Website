- - Create new project — Hit Enter.
- - Your project name: — We can name it whatever we would like. Let's “Portfolio Sanity Data" for this project.
- - Use the default dataset configuration? — The default dataset configuration has a public dataset named “production”, let's stick with that. So type in “Y” and hit Enter.
